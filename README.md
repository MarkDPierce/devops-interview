# Tract Coding Challenge

# Background

The main goal of interviews at TRACT is to find a good fit. We hope that you will enjoy working with us and be able to perform your best work in our environment! To this end, our interviews are not filled with gotchas and brainteasers, but attempt to let us work together in well-reasoned scenarios that mimic a collaborative environment.

# The challenge

Martin is a DevOps engineer. he is part of small team of DevOps engineers helping the development team to build and deploy their code.
The company has registered an org account in GCP platform and want to start the development.
They want to build their infrastructure in code and develop a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the app code in to the infrastructure resources

# Your Goal

Martin should help the development team by building them the infrastructure resource that they need.


# Tools of interest

Interviewer would expect you to focus on mainly 3 toolsets 

- Terraform
- Python
- Jq / Bash

# The Interview Format
You will pair with an interviewer who will observe you code through your solutions. The interviewer may ask questions or offer suggestions, but you will be guiding the direction of the work. You may use any reference materials (StackOverflow, Copilot, etc.) and tools that you use in your normal course of work. We believe that the best engineers will use references when needed, but have enough mastery of basic syntax, skills and best practices that they can work independently to a large measure. The main point is that we want you to feel comfortable and enjoy the interview, using your normal workflow!

# Prep Work
Please fork this repo and look through the code before your interview. You should also have an idea of areas of the code you will want to work on during the interview, so that we don't spend time during the interview trying to find work rather than coding.
While not required, it may help you to spend a few minutes coding in the project to see how it works. You may make any changes you'd like, including adding new packages or adding to or removing current code.
See you in the interview!
